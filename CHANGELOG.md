# Changelog

This changelog documents notable changes made in this fork after diverging from the upstream base at `d4a44b8`.

## Unreleased

### Added
- Added `generate_maps_csv.py` to derive `maps.csv` entries from original iGPSport `.map` filenames.
- Added `run.ps1` and `run.sh` for the full end-to-end workflow: generate `maps.csv`, then build new map files.
- Added project metadata and dependency management via `pyproject.toml`, `.python-version`, and `uv.lock`.
- Added automated tests for the CSV generator in `test_generate_maps_csv.py`.
- Added Python cache and pytest cache ignore rules to `.gitignore`.
- Added option 3 / multi-region source blending for tiles that span several same-country Geofabrik subregions.

### Changed
- Updated `script.ps1` and `script.sh` to make Mapsforge writer tuning configurable.
- Changed the default writer behavior from fixed `hd` mode to adaptive `auto` mode.
- Added RAM-first Mapsforge execution with automatic retry in `hd` mode if the RAM attempt fails.
- Added adaptive Java heap sizing capped to about two thirds of installed RAM.
- Reduced default thread pressure for larger extracts to avoid excessive memory and IO usage.
- Updated the README to describe the new workflow, project setup, adaptive writer behavior, and troubleshooting guidance.
- Updated `generate_maps_csv.py` so one `maps.csv` row can now contain semicolon-separated PBF/poly source lists.
- Updated `script.ps1` and `script.sh` to download, clip, and merge multi-source rows before running the Mapsforge writer.

### Notes
- The generated filename geocode is now based on the actual bounding box stored in the generated `.map` file, so it may differ slightly from the original vendor filename when the produced map coverage differs.
- `run.*` scripts are the full workflow; `script.*` scripts are the map-generation-only step and require an existing `maps.csv`.
