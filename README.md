## Important Notes

### Before You Start

⚠️ **Use At Your Own Risk**: Do it at your own risk; I am not responsible for broken devices.

⚠️ **Backup Your Maps**: Before using the new maps, make sure to backup your existing maps from your IGPSPORT cycle computer. Store them in a safe location in case you need to revert.

⚠️ **Free Up Space**: Remove old maps from your cycle computer before transferring new ones. The new maps are significantly larger due to enhanced tags and more detailed information, so you'll need extra storage space.

⚠️ **Processing Time**: The map conversion process takes several hours to complete, depending on the size of the regions and your computer's performance. Plan accordingly and let the script run without interruption.

### Map Size Changes

The generated maps are **larger than original IGPSPORT maps** because they include:
- More detailed road networks
- Additional map features (waterways, natural features)
- Enhanced tagging information for better routing
- Extended geographic data

### Tag Configuration

This project uses two XML configuration files to control which OpenStreetMap tags are included in the generated maps:

#### Supported Tags ([tag-igpsport.xml](tag-igpsport.xml))

The following **21 tags** are directly supported by IGPSPORT devices:

| Category | Tags | Zoom Level |
|----------|------|------------|
| **Major Roads** | primary, primary_link, secondary, secondary_link, trunk, trunk_link, tertiary, tertiary_link | 13 |
| **Minor Roads** | cycleway, living_street, pedestrian, residential, road, service, track, unclassified | 14 |
| **Natural** | coastline, water | 13 |
| **Waterways** | canal, dam, drain, river, stream | 14 |

#### Tag Transformations ([tag-igpsport-transform.xml](tag-igpsport-transform.xml))

The following **12 transformations** convert unsupported OSM tags to device-compatible equivalents:

| Unsupported Tag | Transformed To | Description |
|-----------------|----------------|-------------|
| `highway=motorway` | `highway=trunk` | Major highways |
| `highway=motorway_link` | `highway=trunk_link` | Highway ramps |
| `highway=footway` | `highway=cycleway` | Pedestrian paths |
| `highway=path` | `highway=cycleway` | Generic paths |
| `highway=bridleway` | `highway=cycleway` | Horse trails |
| `highway=sidewalk` | `highway=cycleway` | Sidewalks |
| `highway=steps` | `highway=pedestrian` | Stairs |
| `highway=byway` | `highway=track` | Rural byways |
| `highway=bus_guideway` | `highway=road` | Guided bus routes |
| `highway=construction` | `highway=road` | Roads under construction |
| `highway=raceway` | `highway=road` | Racing circuits |
| `highway=services` | `highway=service` | Service areas |

This means the maps effectively support **33 highway types** (21 native + 12 transformed).

See the [Mapsforge tag-mapping reference](https://github.com/mapsforge/mapsforge/blob/master/mapsforge-map-writer/src/main/config/tag-mapping.xml) for all available OpenStreetMap tags.

## Quick Start

### 1. Backup your original maps

Connect your iGPSport device via USB and copy all `.map` files from the device to a folder on your computer (e.g., `backup/`). **Keep this backup safe** — you'll need it if you ever want to revert.

### 2. Run the updater

The `run` script does everything in one go: it reads your original map filenames to figure out which regions you need, generates `maps.csv`, downloads the latest OpenStreetMap data, and generates updated `.map` files in the `output/` directory.

#### Windows

```powershell
.\run.ps1 backup\
```

#### Unix/Linux/macOS

```bash
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh backup/
```

This takes a while depending on the number and size of regions.

If you prefer to run the steps separately (e.g., to edit `maps.csv` before generating), see [Running Step by Step](#running-step-by-step).

`run.ps1` / `run.sh` are the full end-to-end workflow. `script.ps1` / `script.sh` are the map-generation-only step and assume `maps.csv` already exists.

### 3. Copy maps to your device

1. Delete the old maps from your iGPSport device
2. Copy the new `.map` files from `output/` to your device
3. Safely eject and restart the device

## Running Step by Step

You can also run each step individually, which is useful if you want to review or manually edit `maps.csv` before generating maps.

### Step 1: Generate maps.csv

```bash
python generate_maps_csv.py backup/
```

The script reads the iGPSport filenames, figures out which geographic regions they cover, and finds the matching download URLs from [Geofabrik](https://download.geofabrik.de/). Review the output to verify the matched regions are correct.

Alternatively, you can create `maps.csv` manually — see [CSV File Structure](#csv-file-structure).

### Step 2: Generate maps

#### Windows

```powershell
.\script.ps1
```

#### Unix/Linux/macOS

```bash
chmod +x script.sh
./script.sh
```

By default, the generator now uses an adaptive Mapsforge configuration:
- It prefers the in-memory (`ram`) writer to avoid excessive temp-file IO.
- It caps Java heap to about 80% of installed RAM.
- It retries once with the disk-backed (`hd`) writer if the RAM attempt fails.

You can still override this manually with `MAP_WRITER_TYPE`, `MAP_WRITER_THREADS`, `JAVA_XMS`, `JAVA_XMX`, and `JAVA_TMP_DIR`.

## What the Script Does

1. **Downloads Osmosis** (if not present) - OpenStreetMap data processing tool (v0.49.2)
2. **Downloads Mapsforge Writer Plugin** (v0.27.0) - Converts OSM data to Mapsforge format
3. **Reads maps.csv** - Configuration file with region definitions
4. **Downloads OSM PBF files** - Raw OpenStreetMap data from Geofabrik
5. **Downloads Polygon files** - Geographic boundary definitions
6. **Transforms tags** - Converts unsupported OSM tags to device-compatible equivalents
7. **Chooses writer settings** - Selects adaptive Mapsforge writer mode, threads, and heap size
8. **Generates maps** - Creates Mapsforge `.map` files with proper zoom levels
9. **Retries if needed** - Falls back from RAM mode to HD mode on writer failure
10. **Renames output** - Calculates GEOCODE and applies IGPSPORT filename convention

## CSV File Structure

The `maps.csv` file defines which regions to process. It has three columns:

| Column | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Original filename** | The target IGPSPORT map filename format | `BR01002303102B83FO00N00E.map` |
| **OSM BPF URL** | URL to download the OpenStreetMap PBF file | `https://download.geofabrik.de/south-america/brazil-latest.osm.pbf` |
| **Poly URL** | URL to download the polygon boundary file | `https://download.geofabrik.de/europe/germany/hessen.poly` |

### Example CSV Content

```csv
Original filename,OSM BPF URL,Poly URL
DE07002303103AO23I01L029.map,https://download.geofabrik.de/europe/germany/hessen-latest.osm.pbf,https://download.geofabrik.de/europe/germany/hessen.poly
DE090023031039R20Z03D02W.map,https://download.geofabrik.de/europe/germany/niedersachsen-latest.osm.pbf,https://download.geofabrik.de/europe/germany/niedersachsen.poly
```

### Where to Find Resources

## IGPSPORT Filename Structure

The generated map files follow a specific naming convention required by IGPSPORT devices:

### Format

```
[CC][RRRR][YYMMDD][GEOCODE].map
```

### Components

| Component | Length | Description | Example |
|-----------|--------|-------------|---------|
| **CC** | 2 chars | Country code | `BR`, `PL`, `US` |
| **RRRR** | 4 digits | Region/Product code | `0100`, `0200` |
| **YYMMDD** | 6 digits | Date (Year, Month, Day) | `250317` = March 17, 2025 |
| **GEOCODE** | 12 chars | Geographic boundary encoding | `2B83FO00N00E` |

### GEOCODE Breakdown (12 characters, Base36 encoding)

The GEOCODE consists of 4 parts, each 3 characters in Base36:

1. **MIN_LON** (XXX): Western boundary - minimum longitude as tile X coordinate at zoom 13
2. **MAX_LAT** (YYY): Northern boundary - maximum latitude as tile Y coordinate at zoom 13
3. **LON_SPAN** (WWW): Width in tiles - 1 (horizontal span)
4. **LAT_SPAN** (HHH): Height in tiles - 1 (vertical span)

![Tile Grid Concept](misc/tile-grid-concept.svg)

### Example

**Filename**: `BR01002303102B83FO00N00E.map`

- **BR**: Brazil
- **0100**: Region code 0100
- **230310**: March 10, 2023
- **2B8**: MIN_LON (tile X at zoom 13)
- **3FO**: MAX_LAT (tile Y at zoom 13)
- **00N**: LON_SPAN (width in tiles)
- **00E**: LAT_SPAN (height in tiles)

## Viewing and Comparing Maps

### Cruiser - Map Viewer

[Cruiser](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Cruiser) is a cross-platform map viewer that supports Mapsforge map files, making it ideal for viewing and comparing the generated maps.

#### Features
- View `.map` files generated by this tool
- Compare different map versions
- Test maps before deploying to IGPSPORT devices
- Supports multiple map formats including Mapsforge

#### Download
Visit the [Cruiser Wiki page](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Cruiser) for download links and documentation.

#### Usage
1. Open Cruiser
2. Load your generated `.map` file from the `output/` directory
3. Compare with other map versions or sources

#### Comparison Example

Below is a comparison showing the difference between the original IGPSPORT map (left) and the enhanced map (right) with additional features and details:

![Map Comparison - Original vs Enhanced](misc/compare-2023-to-2026.jpg)

*Left: Original map (2023) | Right: Enhanced map (2026

## Troubleshooting

### Java Not Found
Ensure Java 17 or higher is installed:
```bash
java -version
```

### Out of Memory Errors
The scripts already choose heap size automatically. If you still run into memory problems, try one of these:

- Force the disk-backed writer: `MAP_WRITER_TYPE=hd`
- Lower the thread count: `MAP_WRITER_THREADS=1`
- Set a smaller heap manually with `JAVA_XMS` / `JAVA_XMX`

Examples:

```powershell
$env:MAP_WRITER_TYPE = "hd"
$env:MAP_WRITER_THREADS = "1"
.\script.ps1
```

```bash
MAP_WRITER_TYPE=hd MAP_WRITER_THREADS=1 ./script.sh
```

### Download Failures
- Check your internet connection
- Verify the URLs in `maps.csv` are accessible
- Some regions may have updated URLs on Geofabrik

### Permission Denied (Unix/Linux)
Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x script.sh
```

## Technical Details

### Processing Pipeline

1. **Read PBF** → Load OpenStreetMap binary data
2. **Apply Polygon** → Filter data to geographic boundary
3. **Tag Filter** → Remove unwanted features, keep roads, waterways, landuse
4. **Used Node** → Keep only referenced nodes
5. **Merge** → Combine filtered data
6. **Mapfile Writer** → Generate Mapsforge `.map` file
7. **Rename** → Calculate GEOCODE and apply IGPSPORT filename

### Map Features Included

The script filters OSM data to include:
- **Roads**: highways, paths, tracks (with tag transformation for unsupported types)
- **Waterways**: rivers, streams, canals, dams, drains
- **Natural features**: water bodies, coastlines

All other features (buildings, POIs, amenities, etc.) are filtered out to reduce file size and focus on navigation.

## Utilities

All utilities use only the Python standard library unless noted otherwise.

### CSV Generator (generate_maps_csv.py)

Automatically generates `maps.csv` from your original iGPSport map files. This is the recommended first step — see [Quick Start](#quick-start).

iGPSport map filenames encode the country, region, and geographic bounding box in a specific format. This script decodes that information and matches each region against the [Geofabrik region index](https://download.geofabrik.de/) (512 regions worldwide) to find the correct PBF and polygon download URLs.

```bash
# Generate maps.csv from your backup directory
python generate_maps_csv.py backup/

# Specify a custom output path
python generate_maps_csv.py backup/ -o my_maps.csv
```

### Map Tag Extractor (extract_tags_map.py)

Inspects the generated `.map` files to show which OSM tags they contain. Useful for verifying that the tag configuration and transformations work as expected, or for comparing your generated maps against the originals.

```bash
python extract_tags_map.py output/map.map            # single file
python extract_tags_map.py backup/                    # all files in folder
python extract_tags_map.py backup/ tags_output/       # with output folder
```

### PBF Tag Extractor (extract_tags_pbf.py)

Analyzes the raw OpenStreetMap source data (`.osm.pbf` files) **before** processing. This is a development tool for working on the tag configuration — it shows which OSM tags exist in the source data and how frequently they appear, helping you decide which tags to include or transform.

**Requires pyosmium** — install with `uv sync --extra pbf`.

```bash
python extract_tags_pbf.py download/hessen-latest.osm.pbf              # display in terminal
python extract_tags_pbf.py download/hessen-latest.osm.pbf -o tags.json -f json  # export to JSON
python extract_tags_pbf.py download/ -o output/ -f csv -m 10           # folder, CSV, min 10 occurrences
```

Options: `-o` output path, `-f` format (text/json/csv), `-m` min occurrence count, `-d` max display count.
